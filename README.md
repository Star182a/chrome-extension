# Locoloader Chrome Extension

### :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
To install the extension, follow this 3-step guide: <a href="https://dev.to/ben/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually-from-github-1612" target="_blank">https://dev.to/ben/how-to-install-chrome-extensions-manually-from-github-1612</a>

If you don't want to install the extension from source, you can still use our [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/locoloader/).

### :thinking: Why not from the Chrome Web Store?
This extension has been in the Chrome Web Store for almost 4 years and has been installed by more than 100k+ users. Unfortunately, it has been removed from the store due to its potential use with adult content.
